"""Export the pinned Kyth System Hub source, then port it to Rowyn on Ubuntu.

The port is deliberately scoped: only the Home/Dashboard, Apps, Updates,
and VPN destinations survive. Play, This PC, Move In, and the shell-only
Dev Tools route are cut from navigation, routing, search, and the sidebar;
their page files stay in the tree (unreferenced) so the cut stays a small,
anchor-checked diff instead of a fork. The Updates channel is repointed at
Rowyn's own releases and GHCR repository, and the update helpers the Hub
shells out to are repointed at the Rowyn implementations the payload
ships (shared/rowyn-safe-upgrade.sh, shared/rowyn-bootc-guard.sh,
shared/rowyn-finalize-staged.sh — fixed-operation counterparts of Kyth's
Rust helpers, with a passwordless sudoers allowlist). Branch switching
stays registered in Rust; the guard it calls implements only Rowyn's
single stable channel and refuses Kyth's other channels.

The VPN destination is Kyth's openconnect client (GlobalProtect "gp"
profile, SAML redirect/cookie/reconnect flow); it ports unchanged apart
from its on-disk paths, which take the Rowyn name. The payload image
provides its runtime stack — openconnect, vpnc-scripts, ksshaskpass (the
askpass the backend fails closed without), and firewalld (the lockdown
feature's one firewall-cmd call) — see the Containerfile.

A final branding sweep rewrites every remaining upstream brand string
in the tree — update status copy, service-layer error prompts, dialog
text, exe-handler suggestion data, and the focus-session inhibit reason
(with its matcher in the shared crate kept in step) — and rekeys the
boot-health OS identity check in updates.rs to Rowyn's os-release ID
(ID=rowyn; the upstream check keyed to ID=kythos would flag every Rowyn
system unhealthy). The sweep is mechanical (counted replace-alls per
file) so a new upstream string fails the port closed in the branding
regression test instead of shipping under the wrong name. Provenance
data that legitimately names KythOS (src/data/compat_games.json, whose
notes record where a compatibility verdict came from) is not rewritten.

Never executes upstream build scripts. The input checkout is read-only; git
archive exports exactly the pinned objects.

# --- Legacy junk cut (approved by Patrick, Oct 30, 2026) -------------------
# The audit counted what the two ports pull over from Kyth: the shared
# crate arrives whole (304 .rs files, ~78k lines) although the two shells
# between them reach only a minority of its modules, and 92 helper-binary
# targets are exported although neither image build compiles any of them.
# The cut below removes, from the exported tree: the helper binaries and
# their manifest sections, the unused library modules (with the whole
# runtime-updater/PGP heritage), the pgp dependency that only the updater
# manifest verifier used, and — on the Hub side — the gaming/dev-tools
# command modules, the `just` recipe runner, and the privileged-socket
# client for a root daemon Rowyn does not ship. The keep set is the
# reviewed reachability closure over the post-cut shells; a module that
# is not listed is dropped with its declaration, so upstream additions
# fail the port closed instead of riding along unreviewed.
